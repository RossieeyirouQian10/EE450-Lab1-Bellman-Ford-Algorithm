# EE450-Lab1-Bellman-Ford-Algorithm
Implement Bellman-Ford algorithm in C++.


Compilation Steps: a. I use Xcode to write my lab1 code in my MacBook Pro. 
                      Also in my zip file, there is a file named "LAB1.xcodeproj". 

                   b. Just directly open it and you will see the lab1 code, named "BellmanFord.cpp".

                   c. To test the code in MacBook, first you should run the whole project, 
                      it will show that "Build Succeed".

                   d. Then, find the terminal named "LAB1" on the left, 
                      and use right click to choose "show in finder".

                   e. Copy the path of the project terminal "LAB1", 
                      and put all test "txt" files under the same path of the project terminal "LAB1".

                   f. Open the Terminal of computer,
                      use command "cd" to go to the dictionary of the project terminal "LAB1".

                   g. Then, use command "LAB1 filename.txt" or "sudo ./LAB1 filename.txt",
                      it will output the result in the text file with the filename “output-filename.txt”.
